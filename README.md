Finding the smallest possible implementation of a script (while adhering to
some standards!).

## Wait, what is this?
I've been challenging myself to find the lowest possible amount of characters
in which I could implement the Caesar shift. I've been doing it in a Gist until
just now. Figured I should just dump it into a repository, see what I can make
out of it. Maybe add some challenges on the way.

I'm keeping strictly to PEP8 (actually, to whatever Flake8 tells me is correct)
and I try not to use any imports cause they're boring.
