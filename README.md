# tiniest-code
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TotempaaltJ/tiniest-code.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/TotempaaltJ/tiniest-code)

Finding the smallest possible implementation of a script (while adhering to
some standards!).

## Wait, what is this?
I've been challenging myself to find the lowest possible amount of characters
in which I could implement the Caesar shift. I've been doing it in a Gist until
just now. Figured I should just dump it into a repository, see what I can make
out of it. Maybe add some challenges on the way.

I'm keeping strictly to PEP8 (actually, to whatever Flake8 tells me is correct)
and I try not to use any imports cause they're boring.

## Feel like challenging me?
Go ahead, make a pull request! It's fairly simple, just take a look at the
`character_shift` directory and the `test` script to see how it's done.

## Think you can do better?
I accept your challenge! Go ahead and fork the repo, it's open source after
all. It'd be cool if you'd make a pull request with your changes, so you can
laugh at me for losing. ;)
